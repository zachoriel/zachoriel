## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Zach, I'm a software developer with a passion for clean architecture, thoughtful systems design, and code that balances efficiency with creativity.

<b>IMPORTANT: Most of my work is in private repositories, which is not reflected in the contributions/activity chart. I do this because I take IP security seriously, and I've had issues in the past with data scrapper bots mass-cloning my projects and doing who knows what with them.</b>

I occasionally publish curated public repos tied to specific projects or job applications.

I have multiple active projects; feel free to check out the one that's currently public here: [Spellcircuit](https://github.com/zachoriel/Spellcircuit), or reach out if you'd like to see more (zachoriel96@gmail.com).

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ™‚

<b>About Me:</b>

- Core Skills: C#, Unity, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Git, CI/CD, Azure DevOps.
- Currently Working On: Spellcircuit (third-person spellcasting roguelite), personal website, and an unnamed cozy forest adventure game.
- Currently Learning: Ruby on Rails, UE5.
- Ask Me About: The time I automated an entire team's art integration pipeline, or the time I made a small family business become the only movie theater in the world (probably) to operate on Unity for a couple weeks.
- How to Reach Me: zachoriel96@gmail.com
- I'm very good at adapting to legacy codebases and writing documentation. 

<b>Fun Facts! (Because I like fun facts.)</b>
- Botanically speaking, bananas are classified as berries, but strawberries aren't.
- If you could fold a piece of paper 42 times, the thickness would surpass the average distance between Earth and the moon.
- Chilchillas can jump over 6 feet upwards â€” and I happen to live with one who rules my apartment like a fuzzy, loveable tyrant.
- Cleopatra lived closer in time to the modern day than to the construction of the pyramids.
- The Anglo-Portuguese Alliance is the world's longest continuously existing alliance in history, dating back to 1373. It was last invoked in 1982 during the Falklands war, and before that in 1943 during World War Two â€” despite Portuguese President AntÃ³nio de Oliveira Salazar being Axis-aligned in a dictatorial regime.
- The east-African autonomous region of Somaliland has operated as a de-facto independent nation for decades, despite receiving no formal recognition on the world stage due to Somalia's claims on the territory. Nevertheless, Somaliland has their own stable government/political process, currency, legal system, and military. In 2024, Ethiopia nearly became the first UN nation to recognize Somaliland's sovereignty, but the agreement collapsed after Somalian protest.
- 94% of the universe's galaxies are pemanently beyond our sight. The universe is constantly expanding, and moreover, the galaxies within it are also <i>accelerating</i>; most galaxies are estimated to already be receding from us faster than the speed of light. This means that the light emitted from these galaxies will never reach us, and we've effectively missed our chance to observe nearly all of the universe, simply by being billions of years too late.
