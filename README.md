## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Zach, I'm a software developer with a passion for clean architecture, thoughtful systems design, and code that balances efficiency with creativity.

<b>IMPORTANT: Most of my work is in private repositories, which is not reflected in the contributions/activity chart. I do this because I take IP security seriously, and I've had issues in the past with data scrapper bots mass-cloning my projects and doing who knows what with them.</b>

I occasionally publish curated public repos tied to specific projects or job applications.

I have multiple active projects; feel free to check out the two that are currently public here: [We Have C At Home](https://github.com/zachoriel/We-Have-C-At-Home) and [Spellcircuit](https://github.com/zachoriel/Spellcircuit), or reach out if you'd like to see more (zachoriel96@gmail.com).

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ™‚

<b>Fun Facts! (Because I like fun facts.)</b>
- Botanically speaking, bananas are classified as berries, but strawberries aren't.
- If you could fold a piece of paper 42 times, the thickness would surpass the average distance between Earth and the moon.
- Cleopatra lived closer in time to the modern day than to the construction of the pyramids.
- 94% of the universe's galaxies are pemanently beyond our sight. The universe is constantly expanding, and moreover, the galaxies within it are also <i>accelerating</i>; most galaxies are estimated to already be receding from us faster than the speed of light. This means that the light emitted from these galaxies will never reach us, and we've effectively missed our chance to observe nearly all of the universe, simply by being billions of years too late.
